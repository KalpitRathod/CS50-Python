# CS50-Python
This all I learn in the CS50-Python by Harvard University Course

This is the link to freecodecamp CS50 Harvard Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLRL_NcnK-4

All the code that I will run and practice will be here with comments.

I am doing it in 10 days span, I already know some python, I just need to sharpen my skills.

Also, this will be my reference directory if I wanted any pre-template for any code.
